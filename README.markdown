Pro Football Scores Repository
==============================

Created by [Jeff Self](http://www.jeffself.net/)

Welcome to my *Pro Football Scores repository*.  I have accumulated scores from the **NFL** dating back to 1940.  I also have scores for the entire history of the **AFL**.

At this current time, the scores are delimited by spaces.  The format is as follows:

**date  visitor  score  home  score  neutral**

Here's an example:

`12/12/2010  Philadelphia        30  Dallas              27`

If the game is played on a neutral site, a **N** is placed after the home team's score following a couple of spaces.

Here's an example:

02/07/2010  New Orleans         31  Indianapolis        17 N
