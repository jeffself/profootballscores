Pro Football Scores Repository
==============================

Created by [Jeff Self](http://www.jeffself.net/)

Welcome to my *Pro Football Scores repository*.  I have accumulated scores from the **NFL** dating back to 1940.  I also have scores for the entire history of the **AFL**.

At this current time, the scores are delimited by spaces.  The format is as follows:

**date  visitor  score  home  score  neutral**

Here's an example:

`12/12/2010  Philadelphia        30  Dallas              27`

If the game is played on a neutral site, a **N** is placed after the home team's score following a couple of spaces.

Here's an example:

`02/07/2010  New Orleans         31  Indianapolis        17 N`

*Update*: 12/14/2010
Just noticed that many of the older files for scores had a slightly different format for games.  Many of them use a '1' to indicate a game played at the home team's field and a '0' to indicate a game played at a neutral site.

Here's an example:

`01/05/1964  Boston              10  San Diego           51 1`

`01/26/1986  Chicago             46  New England         10 0`

Also have noticed that many of the files are using tabs to separate the teams and scores.  Will correct that as time permits.
